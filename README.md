# An experimental Real Time Collaboration Framework for Snap!

The basic idea is described in the paper titled [Kanto: A Multi-participant Screen-Sharing System for
Etoys, Snap!, and GP](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/kanto-framework.pdf). it sets up WebRTC connection for sharing displayed bits in a canvas, and events on the remote users.

You can see it in action [here](https://tinlizzie.org/kanto/snap). To try it, first open the URL in one tab. The URL gets an identifier in the form of ?q=. Copy the URL to a new tab to start a collaborative session. The image starts blurry but it will get crispy after 15 seconds or so.
